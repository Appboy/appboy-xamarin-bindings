## Components

The format of this repository is that of a Xamarin component:  under appboy-component you will find the directories src, 
libs, component, and samples.  Libs, src, and samples each contain two directories, one for Android and one for iOS.  The directories
contains:

- libs:  the compiled DLL bindings for the Appboy SDKs.
- src:  the Xamarin bindings projects that generated the DLLs found in the libs folder.
- samples:  Xamarin applications that show how to use the bindings to access the Appboy feature set.
- component:  this contains the information required generate the Xamarin component found in the component store. This can 
generally be ignored, unless you are integrating the Xamarin component and want to see how it is generated.

## Version Support

The Android SDK supports Android 2.2+ (Froyo and up).  The iOS SDK supports iOS 5.1.1+.
